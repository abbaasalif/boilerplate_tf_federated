tf federated learning API boiler plate code - latest code for running federated learning API of tf

Federated learning - It is the process of securing PII type data of users where the ML model runs on a edge device typically mobile phones and then the "inferences" - last layers of a model trained 
are passed to the server where it will aggregate a cluster of devices inferences and train a global model which in turn will be used as the new model in the edge devices for further
usage.
